* Overview
Run macOS Mojave (10.14) or Catalina (10.15) on an Acer Swift3 SF315 52G.
Most pieces are fully supported, and this setup can be used as your main machine. A few pieces are missing (and some will probably never be supported). Caveats in the Hardware section.
You can use the EFI folder to be to boot into a USB installer, or for regular booting.

* Hardware
** Graphics
Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620 support is handled by [[https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen][WhateverGreen]], and configured in the
=PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)= section of config.plist. The Nvidia GPU MX150 is not supported due to hardware differences and lack of driver support in macOS. It is disabled to save power.

1536 MB. A value less than 1536MB indicates a problem (e.g. 7MB or 31MB are common).
** Touchpad
Acer-Swift3-SF315-52G using Touchpad Synaptic. If only using VoodooI2C and VoodooPS2Controller it will not work smoothly, you need to patch [[https://github.com/linhnguyengas/Hackintosh-Acer-Swift3-SF315-52G/blob/master/Patch%20I2C/SSDT-I2C.dsl][SSDT-I2C]] to be able to use as a real Trackpad of Macbook 
** Wi-Fi/Bluetooth
*** Installation
- Include [[https://github.com/acidanthera/AirportBrcmFixup][AirportBrcmFixup]] for Wi-Fi
- Include [[https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM/releases][BrcmPatchRAM]] for Bluetooth (for installation to CLOVER/kexts/Other)
** Messages and FaceTime
You can try this tips https://hackintosher.com/guides/quick-fixes-facetime-icloud-imessage-hackintosh-not-working/ or https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/an-idiots-guide-to-imessage.196827/
** Battery status
Install =SMCBatteryManager.kext= that comes with [[https://github.com/acidanthera/virtualsmc/releases][VirtualSMC]] to get battery status. Ensure that you have removed ACPIBatteryManager if youâ€™ve installed it previously.
** Audio 
Audio on the Acer Swift3 SF315 52G is based on the Realtek ALC256 audio codec. The ALC256 is not supported on macOS by default, so we use AppleALC to enable it. Audio pipelines on laptops appear to have unique amplifier and gain setups, so we need to pass a layout-id to AppleALC compatible with the Acer Swift3 SF315 52G. The only ID that works well is layout-id=17.
